  EasyLayout 1.0
  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

  EasyLayout is flexible and easy to use grid based 
  LayoutManager. EasyLayout is designed for making form design 
  easier and quicker without need of fancy drag and drop form 
  painters. 
  
  The idea int EasyLayout is to use grid to layout components.
  The grid is based on columns and rows, for each row has to 
  be define size and resizing values. Size can be read 
  automatically from  components or it can be defined by 
  pixel values. Resizing is defined by percentage values 
  for each column and row.
